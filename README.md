# Some tools for using qiskit and qiskit ibm runtime

#### [./qexperiments](./qexperiments)

Python package of analysis code that is probably fairly generally useful. This can be installed
with `pip install -e .`. This has minimal installation scripts. I want the easiest way
to reuse code with maximum relocatability.


#### [./qexperiments](./qexperiments)

Code that has been useful for projects, but is not suitble for [./qexperiments](./qexperiments).
This is is because it may not be generally useful enough, or because it's too rough.

### Dependencies

* See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for Python deps.
