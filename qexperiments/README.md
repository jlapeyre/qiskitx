# qexperiments

I add here library-like code for using `qiskit` and `qiskit_ibm_runtime`.

I want easy to use, relocatable code.

## Contents

### `backends`

* `CLOPS` data for available backends. This is not otherwise availabele via an API, AFAICT.
* `circuits` perform some operations on circuits.
* `versions` fetch some version info from important components.

## Dependencies

`requirements.txt` is won't stay entirely correct. Python-world does not have
an easy way to verify, so I don't try.
